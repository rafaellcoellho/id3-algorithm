# ID3 Algorithm

This program implement ID3 algorithm. This is part of an exercise from computational intelligence class.

```
In decision tree learning, ID3 (Iterative Dichotomiser 3) is an algorithm invented 
by Ross Quinlan[1] used to generate a decision tree from a dataset. ID3 is the 
precursor to the C4.5 algorithm, and is typically used in the machine learning 
and natural language processing domains.
